# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Custom, simplified implementation of some CPU scheduling algorithms in Python.

- `utilities.py` has all of the utility classes and functions needed to implement the algorithms in an easier manner. Classes like `Process`, `SubProcess` and `Gantt` have been implemented for better modularity and reusability.
- All of the algorithms have been implemented in their respective files as well.
